# 🧱 Photo/Text to 3D Model Generator

This project allows users to **generate basic 3D models** (`.obj` and `.stl`) using either:
- 🖼️ **Images** (photos with simple backgrounds)
- 📝 **Text prompts** (like "Generate a cube", "Create a house")

The app uses Python, computer vision, and basic 3D geometry to convert visual/text input into downloadable 3D models.

# Features

- 🧊 Generate simple 3D models from text prompts.
- ✂️ Extract objects from images using background removal.
- 📦 Export models as `.obj` and `.stl` formats (3D printing compatible).
- 🔍 Preview 3D models in real-time (upcoming).
- 🖥️ Simple Python-based local interface (CLI for now).
- 📂 Output folder stores your generated models.
